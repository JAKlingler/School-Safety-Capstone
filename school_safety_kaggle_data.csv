Brewer High School at around 8:28 a.m. on May 21, 1985. That vehicle eventually left the area, but Biles noticed the vehicle again at around 1:16 p.m. Four minutes later, Deputy Biles radioed in, stating he had been shot and needed assistance. He had reportedly approached the driver’s side of the suspicious vehicle to ask for their ID when he saw the barrel of a semi-automatic rifle. While trying to push the barrel of the gun away from his head and toward the driver, authorities say Biles heard a click. “As he reached for the barrel, he heard a “click” but did not know if it was the safety or the hammer on the weapon. Just as he touched the barrel, he heard the weapon fire and felt his chest burn,” the MCSO said in their post remembering Biles. The vehicle was driving away, but not before it is said Deputy Biles got a few shots in and even hit the suspect’s gas tank, causing him to run out of gas in Cullman County. Cullman County authorities were notified by a couple who had been listening to scanners that the out-of-gas vehicle was at Hebron Church. A Cullman County Deputy and a Blount County Deputy approached the car and the suspect, directing them to throw the weapon and exit the car. It was reported that the suspect was a minor and former Brewer High student armed with a semi-automatic rifle, two rifle clips, 372 rounds of ammunition and a knife and dealing with mental health issues.
